# About the workshop

Welcome! The objective of this workshop is to have the attendee complete a full React application using Redux state management, GraphQL API integration, and some unit testing. At the end of the workshop, the attendee will deploy the application to Kubernetes on the IBM Cloud. 🎉

The workshop will be broken up into several chapters, each one covering a different topic to guide the attendee to build the final application. Each chapter can either be completed individually or groups. If an attendee gets lost at any time, the completed code for each chapter is provided, which can be downloaded into a new Code Sandbox.
